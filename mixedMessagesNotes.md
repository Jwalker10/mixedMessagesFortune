## Goal:
To create a javascript program that returns a random message like a fortune cookie.
The message will be split into two parts.

+ luck
+ action

The luck will present someones current luck and will read like e.g. You are fortunate or e.g. You are in serious trouble.
The action will be vague advice to either rid yourself of bad luck or preserve your good luck e.g. keep your friends close and an eye on your enemies.
